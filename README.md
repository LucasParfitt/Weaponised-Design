> Examining how the online age has built, **and weaponised**, a new generation of designers.
                                                                                                
## Introduction

*The pen was never my weapon of choice. I've been born into a world in which design is a far cry once was. My father is a Graphic Designer. He would tell me of his time in Art School almost 40 years ago. A time in which design was far more black and white, a time in which (for good or bad) design was an artform and not merely a means of creating propaganda. Propaganda for insitutions, for politicians or for individuals. Before computers, before phones, before bluetooth-enabled sentient hoovers and touch-screen fridges, designers relied on pen, paper and scalpels to produce elaborate pieces of art spanning from posters to bus wraps. God did it sound tedious.*

*I am a product of the electronic age. I’m tethered to my phone, my laptop is my notepad and my digital camera shows me my photos in 2 seconds, not 2 weeks. I have been brought up on a steady diet of social media and forced advertising, ultimately making me the media-hungry monster that most of us have become. Although this all sounds oh-so horrible, I've loved it. Despite the enormous fostering of hate online, something else has also been fostered… a community. Not a community with a handful of people, but an online community encompassing millions, an online community that taught me design and, ultimately, weaponised it.*

## Context

*Graphic Design has always been indicative of the age in which it was created: From the 40s constructivist ideological graphics, to the 60s psychodelic rock band posters (below); design has had the difficult task of reflecting current society. Our society, however, is like no other before. Our constant and unending bombartement of media, most of it from past generations, has left this generation of designers with millions of peices of inspiration, all found just a click away.*

*This abundance of inspiration can leave us feeling lost and, well, we kind of are. The design tendancy now, especially amongst this young generation of designers, almost always tries to replicate a feeling of nostalgia: Either by adding copious amounts of grain to imageres or by using physical techniques to reproduce the style of 90s magazines like "Blah Blah Blah", "The Face" or "Ray Gun". However, when these styles were pioneered, the designers were not subject to the enormous pressures of the online community to accurately and equally represent all ideologies and beliefs. This leaves the current community of young designers having to not only innovate, but also do so under the constant scrutinization of an all-seeing digisphere. Everything we will ever create, especially that which we will create for comercial purposes, will not only have to be progressive enough to please a liberal audience, but also traditional enough to not anger and rile the conservative audience; therefore leaving nobody feeling alienated. This, at its core, is the main proplem facing the modern deisgner. How will we symoltaneusly create change and maintain a livelihood?*

***THE INTERNET IS NOT EVIL, YET IT MUST BE USED CORRECTLY.***


EVERYTHING MUST BE CONSIDERED. Everything is ideologically charged. Some weapons are for good and others for evil

- past design can inspire us, the internet is there to help us learn, and to spread
- It is impossible to escape ideology and the digisphere, everything we make will forever be scrutinised and also represent our society. Our design is a weapon for change now, and a weapon for love, or hate in the future (Nazi posters)
- The COMMUNITY has left us able to be constantly judged by everyone
