# Weaponised Design

> Examining how the online age has built, and weaponised, a new generation of designers.

*The pen was never my weapon of choice. I have been born into a world now a far cry from what design once was. My father is a graphic designer. He would tell me of his time in Art School almost 40 years ago. A time in which design was far more black and white, a time in which design was an artform and not merely a means of creating propaganda. Before computers, before phones, before bluetooth-enabled sentient hoovers and touch-screen fridges, designers relied on pen, paper and scalpels to produce elaborate pieces of design spanning from leaflets to bus wraps. God did it sound boring.*

*I am a product of the electronic age. I’m tethered to my phone, my laptop is my notepad and my digital camera shows me my photos in 2 seconds, not 2 weeks. I have been brought up on a steady diet of social media and forced advertising, ultimately making me the media-hungry monster that most of us have become. Although this all sounds oh-so horrible, I've loved it. With all the fostering of hate online, something else has also been built … a community, not one with a handful of people, but an online community encompassing millions, an online community that, ultimately, taught me design.*
